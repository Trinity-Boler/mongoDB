This project is an extension of the Personal Budget App from Coding Exercise 01.
Originally, the project used a hardcoded budget.json file to load chart data.
In this version, the app has been upgraded to use MongoDB as a live database, allowing the website to dynamically fetch and update data through an Express server and Mongoose.
